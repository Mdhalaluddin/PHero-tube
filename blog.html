    <h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-8 px-8">A lot of shiny new features came out with ES2015 (ES6). And now, since it's 2020, 
        <br><span class="text-center">it's assumed</span>  
        <br> that a lot of JavaScript developers have become <br>
         familiar with and have started using these features.</h2>
         <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 px-8">Var</h1>
         <p class="p-8 font-medium">Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. <br>There are issues associated with variables declared with var, though. <br> That is why it was necessary for new ways to declare variables to emerge. <br> First, let's get to understand var more before we discuss those issues.</p>
         <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 px-8">Let</h1>
         <p class="p-8 font-medium">let is now preferred for variable declaration. <br> It's no surprise as it comes as an improvement to var declarations. <br> It also solves the problem with var that we just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
         <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 px-8">Const</h1>
         <p class="p-8 font-medium">Const (constant) in programming is a keyword that defines a variable or pointer as unchangeable. <br> A const may be applied in an object declaration to indicate that the object, unlike a standard variable, does not change. <br> Such fixed values for objects are often termed literals.</p>
         <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 px-8 text-center">Undefined vs Null</h1>
         <p class="p-8 font-medium">Undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. Null means an empty value or a blank value. <br> The typeof() operator returns undefined for an undefined variable. <br> The typeof() operator returns the type as an object for a variable whose value is assigned as null.</p>
         <p class="text-4xl font-bold mt-8 px-8">What is Undefined?</p>
         <p class="p-8 font-medium"> There is a subtle difference between null and undefined, but as a programmer, it is important that we understand it clearly.

            As the name suggests, undefined means "not defined". So we declare a variable but do not assign a value to it, the variable becomes undefined.
            
            Unlike null, the value of an undefined variable is set by JavaScript as undefined. The variable gets created at the run-time. When we do not pass an argument for a function parameter, the default value is taken as undefined. Besides, when a function doesn't return a value, it returns undefined.</p>
